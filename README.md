# Housing-Model
A work in progress project to produce a simulation of capitalistic housing markets.

Currently the model is unfinished and therefore unworking.
It really only needs to the market mechanisms put in for it to work, but I keep getting
distracted by things I need to fix or upgrade in the existing code.

The idea behind this model is to produce a bunch of "houses" as well as "people" who
will need to periodically move. The simulation will be responsive to changes the user
can program into the market such as more skewed income distributions, and changes in 
interest rates. The goal is to study how the RULES of the housing system affect prices
and eventually supply.

As the code stands now, only the basic features of the simulation are nearing completion,
however, I would like to continue adding features such as the ability to economic conditions
to arrise that encourage new house construction.

Whether or not I'm too ambitious with this project is honestly besides the point to me.
Either way, it's good Python practice.
